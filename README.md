The Online Shopping Cart System
[WLO: 1] [CLOs: 2, 3, 5]

Prior to beginning work on this assignment, be sure to review Chapter 7, including reviewing corresponding Participation Activities, Challenge Activities, and this weekâ€™s laboratories, particularly 15.17 Program: Online shopping cart (continued).

Applying skills you acquired this week, compile and execute a C++ program that expands on the program in 15.17 Program: Online shopping cart (continued). Your program must include at least one of the following features:

    use and apply coupon codes
    additional discount features, such as a discount percentage with a minimum purchase
    shipping costs
    send notifications to the customers that do not complete their shopping

Your program must use appropriate arithmetic operators; input/output methods; selection statements such as if-else; and looping statements such as while, for, and do-while. Your program should exhibit input-data gathering and problem-solving using data structures and display the output. You must model classes and their relationship.
